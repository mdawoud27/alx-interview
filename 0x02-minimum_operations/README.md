# Project: 0x02. Minimum Operations

*For this project, you will need to understand several key algorithmic and mathematical concepts to devise a solution that efficiently calculates the minimum number of operations to achieve a given number of characters using only “Copy All” and “Paste” operations. Here is a list of concepts and resources that will be helpful:*

## Concepts Needed:
1. Dynamic Programming:
   - Familiarity with dynamic programming can help in breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and building up the solution.
   - [Dynamic Programming (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/)

2. Prime Factorization:
   - Understanding how to perform prime factorization is crucial since the problem can be reduced to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number `n`.
   - [Prime Factorization (Khan Academy)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra/pre-algebra-factors-multiples/pre-algebra-prime-factorization-prealg/v/prime-factorization)

3. Code Optimization:
   - Knowing how to approach problems from an optimization perspective can be useful in finding the most efficient solution.
   - [How to optimize Python code](https://stackify.com/how-to-optimize-python-code/)

4. Greedy Algorithms:
   - The problem can also be approached with greedy algorithms, choosing the best option at each step.
   - [Greedy Algorithms (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms/)

5. Basic Python Programming:
   - Proficiency in Python, including loops, conditionals, and functions, is necessary to implement the solution.
